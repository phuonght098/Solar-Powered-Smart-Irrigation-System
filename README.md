# 1. Introduction

This project presents a solar-powered smart irrigation system designed to automatically monitor environmental conditions and irrigate plants only when necessary.

The system is built around the ESP8266 microcontroller and integrates multiple sensors including soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and CO₂ concentration. Sensor data are uploaded to Firebase Realtime Database while users can remotely monitor and manually control the irrigation process through the Blynk IoT mobile application.

The primary objective of this project is to reduce water consumption, enable renewable-energy-powered agriculture, and provide a low-cost IoT solution suitable for home gardens and small-scale farming.
# 2. Features

🌞 Solar Powered
- Operates entirely from a photovoltaic charging system with rechargeable Li-ion batteries.

💧 Automatic Irrigation

☁️ Cloud Data Logging
- Uploads sensor data to Firebase Realtime Database for cloud storage.

🌡️ Environmental Monitoring
- Measures temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, and CO₂ concentration in real time.

🔋 Battery Monitoring
- Estimates remaining battery voltage using a voltage divider circuit.

🛠️ Open Source
- Complete hardware design, firmware source code, PCB files, and documentation are included.

## 3.1 BOM
| Component | Qty |
| --------- | --- |
| Solar panel 6v 10W | 1 |
| ESP8266 | 1 |
| DHT11 | 1 |
| 18650 (4200mAh) | 3 |
| TP4056 | 1 |
| Relay | 1 |
| XL6009 | 2 |
| LCD1602 | 1 |
| Pump | 1 | 

## Energy Consumption Analysis

The estimated daily energy consumption of the system is summarized in the table below.

| Component | Operating Time | Power | Daily Energy Consumption |
| :--- | :---: | ---: | ---: |
| ESP8266 + LCD + DHT11 | 24 hours | ≈ 1.2 W | 1.2 × 24 = **28.8 Wh** |
| Water Pump (12 V, 6 W) | 5 cycles × 10 s = 50 s/day | 6 W | 6 × (50 / 3600) ≈ **0.085 Wh** |
| **Total** | | | **≈ 28.885 Wh/day** |

Assuming the **XL6009 boost converter** has an efficiency of approximately **90%**, the total energy drawn from the battery per day is

```text
E_battery = 28.885 / 0.9 ≈ 32 Wh/day
```

---

## Solar Energy Estimation

The system uses a **6 V, 10 W solar panel**.

Assuming approximately **6 hours of effective sunlight** per day, the theoretical harvested energy is

```text
10 W × 6 h = 60 Wh/day
```

Considering practical conditions such as sunlight angle, dust, and weather, the actual solar panel efficiency is assumed to be approximately **70%**.

```text
Effective solar energy = 60 × 0.7 = 42 Wh/day
```

After accounting for the charging efficiency of the **TP4056 charging module** (approximately **90%**), the actual energy stored in the battery becomes

```text
42 × 0.9 ≈ 37 Wh/day
```

Therefore, the daily energy surplus is

```text
37 Wh − 32 Wh ≈ 5 Wh/day
```

This surplus compensates for battery losses and helps maintain the battery at a safe operating level.

---

## Battery Backup Estimation

The system is powered by **three 18650 Li-ion batteries connected in parallel**.

- Battery capacity (per cell): **4200 mAh**
- Nominal voltage: **3.7 V**

Therefore, the total stored battery energy is

```text
E = 3.7 × 12.6 ≈ 46.6 Wh
```

During nighttime or in the absence of solar energy, the system is powered solely by the battery pack.

The estimated battery backup time is

```text
Battery Backup Time = 46.6 Wh / 32 Wh/day
                    ≈ 1.456 days
                    ≈ 35 hours
```
